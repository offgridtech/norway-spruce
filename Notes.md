# Important Notes

We are going to keep only one page of notes here, so we don't waste time taking notes in all of the code as we go.

## Component Based CSS

You want to build all of your components like the nav bar, banner/hero section, buttons, input fields + buttons, badges, cards, links, grids, media objects, testimonials, callout components (take aciton). You build these in isolation as if nothing else exists, and then you put them together in the end.

## Color Palette

Primary, secondary, and accent colors.

For the Norway Spruce page, let's make green the primary color with different shades of green as secondary colors. An accent color sticks out, like red or orange or yellow. Play around with the accent colors to see what would look best with the different shades of green.
