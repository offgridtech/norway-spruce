# Important Notes

We are going to keep only one page of notes here, so we don't waste time taking notes in all of the code as we go.

## Component Based CSS

You want to build all of your components like the nav bar, banner/hero section, buttons, input fields + buttons, badges, cards, links, grids, media objects, testimonials, callout components (take action). You build these in isolation as if nothing else exists, and then you put them together in the end.

## Color Palette

Primary, secondary, and accent colors.

For the Norway Spruce page, let's make green the primary color with different shades of green as secondary colors. An accent color sticks out, like red, orange or yellow. Play around with the accent colors to see what would look best with the different shades of green.

## Minimize the Number of Fonts

Page load times decreases when you have less stuff loading, so stick with the least amount of font styles possible. Every variation of a font becomes a separate font file, so keep everything simple and minimal.
